abstract: |
  Standardised cognitive assessments form a core part of many Educational Psychologistâ€™s (EPs) work. However, these tools are controversial and there are many questions around their use. These questions range from questions around how many EPs use standardised cognitive assessments and their views of them to what alternatives they use. There is also a lack of data on EPs views towards the training they received on standardised cognitive assessments.

# Introduction

Research questions
1) What are EPs and TEPs views towards the use of standardised cognitive assessments, including the reasons for their use?
2) What are some of the alternative tools EPs and TEPs use to explore cognitive ability?
3) What are EPs and TEPs views towards the training they received on standardised cognitive assessments?

# Methods
We report how we determined our sample size, all data exclusions (if any), all manipulations, and all measures in the study. <!-- 21-word solution (Simmons, Nelson & Simonsohn, 2012; retrieved from http://ssrn.com/abstract=2160588) -->
